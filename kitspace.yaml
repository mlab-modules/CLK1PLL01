summary: PLL clock generator with Texas Instruments chip CDCE913. Contains VCXO with
  external xtal andone internal PLL. It has three LVCMOS outputs with individual frequency
  dividers capable togenerate ut to 230MHz clocks. The chip is programmable via I2C
  and configuration may be savedto internal EEPROM.
